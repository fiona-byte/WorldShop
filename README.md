# Getting Started with WorldShop

This project was created with React (Javascript).

## Steps to run the app

1. Clone the repository into your local machine.
2. Run the command `npm install` to install all the dependencies needed for the app to function properly.
3. Run the command `npm start` to start the app in the development mode.\
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Additional features implemented

1. Product listing page
2. Product details page
3. Checkout page

## Approach to the project

1. Understanding the project requirements.
2. Created a rough sketch of what the UI should look like whilst getting inspirations from UI websites such as Dribbble, Behance.
3. I began the development process by implementing the UI while ensuring that the file structure was in order.
4. Continued the development process by adding the required functionalities while taking the performance of the app into consideration.

## Tradeoffs

1. Couldn't use the ChimoneyAPI to display the giftcards as products because some the objects returned null on the min and max recipient denomination value.

## How to improve the performance of the ï¬‚ipbook (e.g. smoother frame rate)

1. Use a preloading mechanism eg. MUI skeleton loader.
2. Optimizing the image without sacrificing the image quality.
